**📌 Wireshark Packet Analysis**

**Project 🧠 Summary**

This project showcases my ability to use Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer, to perform an in-depth analysis of a packet capture file. I meticulously examined network traffic to answer a series of technical questions by applying filters and inspecting various protocol layers. This project demonstrates core skills in network fundamentals, cybersecurity, and data analysis.

**⚙️ Tools & Tech**

Wireshark: The primary tool used for network packet analysis.

Linux Terminal (Ubuntu): Used for command-line operations, including file integrity checks.

Packet Capture File (.pcapng): The dataset used for the analysis.

**🗂️ Features**

Foundational Network Analysis: Successfully identified key information such as the total number of packets, TCP payload size, and the TTL value of specific packets.

Protocol-Level Inspection: Used Wireshark's filtering capabilities to isolate and analyze specific protocols like HTTP.

Data Extraction: Extracted hidden information, including a flag, an MD5 hash, and a message.

HTTP Stream Analysis: Followed HTTP streams to examine server responses and extract critical details.

**🖼️ Project Walkthrough**

Here are screenshots demonstrating my process and the key findings.

**🔎 Answering Key Questions**

This section shows my process for answering basic questions about the packet capture file.

**✅ What I Learned**


This project was a fantastic exercise in applying theoretical network knowledge in a practical setting. I strengthened my skills in:

Packet-Level Detail: Understanding the structure and meaning of data within individual packets.

Efficient Filtering: Using display and capture filters to quickly narrow down large datasets.

Forensic Thinking: Looking beyond the surface to find hidden or less obvious information within network traffic.

This experience reinforces my confidence in tackling more complex network analysis challenges.
